# Mad-Libs
Just a test to create a mad lib game using github

This initial game with pop up UI for user to choose which generator to choose from. 

#places to improve
1. There's no checking in user input. Basically the user can input anything they want even it is not according to the instruction. A better version would be the one that could check the user input and re-prompt them if they input something off from the intended ones. 
2. There's no pop up window for mad-libs generator after the user click on which mad-lib to go to.
